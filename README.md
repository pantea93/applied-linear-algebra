The core of modern applied mathematics.

Basis for numerical analysis, data science, engineering, and
more.

Applications: Solving linear systems with unique or multiple solutions.

Applications of Linear Systems:

Examples from Real-World Applications:

▶ Electrical Circuits: Kirchhoff’s laws lead to systems of equations to determine current and voltage.

▶ Structural Engineering: Forces and stresses in a truss structure can be modelled as a system of equations.

▶ Economics: Input-output models describe interdependencies in an economy using linear equations.

▶ Computer Graphics: Transformations and projections are computed using matrix equations.
